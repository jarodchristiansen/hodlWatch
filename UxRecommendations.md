Before diving into specifics, here’s a high-level overview of our recommendations: maintain a 60/30/10 color balance using trust-evoking blues and growth-oriented greens balanced by neutrals; choose clean, highly legible typography (e.g. Lato or Inter for body, Futura or a robust serif for headlines) with clear hierarchy; and apply landing-page best practices—targeted messaging, benefit-led copy, simple/distraction-free layouts, and mobile optimization—to reinforce professionalism and drive conversions. Below, you’ll find carefully selected hex codes, font choices, and UX patterns—each grounded in industry research.

1. Color Palette Recommendations
   60/30/10 Rule
   Use one primary color on 60% of the page (backgrounds, large sections), a secondary on 30% (navigation, sidebars), and an accent on 10% (CTAs, highlights) to create visual harmony and hierarchy

Hierarchy & Spacing
H1: 32–36 px, H2: 24–28 px, Body: 16 px, Small text: 14 px.

Maintain 1.5× line-height for body text and adequate margins (at least 24 px) between sections to prevent clutter
